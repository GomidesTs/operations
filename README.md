# operations

math operations applied to number

For today's challenge we will cover the basics of javaScript applied to the web

- Variables;
- Math operations;
- Comparative operators;
- Parole.

The code for the following operations

- [x] The sum of the two numbers;
  
```js
let sun = firstNumber + secondNumber
```

- [x] The subtraction of the two numbers;

```js
let sub = firstNumber - secondNumber
```

- [x] The multiplication of the two numbers;

```js
let mul = firstNumber * secondNumber
```

- [x] The division of the two numbers;

```js
let div = firstNumber / secondNumber
```

- [x] The remainder of the division of the two numbers;

```js
let rem = firstNumber % secondNumber
```

For greater challenge the code will check the following conditions

- [x] Check if the sum of the two numbers is even or odd;

```js
if (sun % 2 == 0) {
  console.log("The sum of the two numbers is even")
} else {
  console.log("The sum of the two numbers is odd")
}
```

- [x] Check whether the two numbers entered are the same or different.

```js
if (firstNumber > secondNumber) {
     alert(`The first number is greater than the second`)
} else if (firstNumber < secondNumber) {
     alert(`The first number is less than the second`)
} else {
     alert(`The numbers are the same`)
}
```
